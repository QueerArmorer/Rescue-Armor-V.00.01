Welcome to Rescue Armor! The name is a geeky reference to the original intention of this project:

The "Rescue Armor" in Iron Man is a suit of armor made for Pepper Potts. In the MCU, the Rescue Armor set was specifically designed to have a lot of the fighting capabilities of the iron man suit but it was designed (and redesigned) so that someone who didn't know or do a lot of advanced technical things could operate it.
That's our goal here. We want to make a suite of tools that, when set up and implemented at the end, could be installed by someone with minimal information security experience and be used to spot bad actors.
Our short term goal is thinking this is for someone who will be monitoring a team and setting up a team's computers for them, with teams and friendgroups being interchangable in this instance.
Our long term goal is this should be plug and play on any Windows system and it just works, with variants for Mac and Linux coming.
